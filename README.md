# NumPy Code Examples

This repository contains examples of NumPy code demonstrating various functionalities and operations.

## Description

NumPy is a powerful Python library used for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

## Installation

To use NumPy, you can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Usage

Each Python script in this repository demonstrates a specific aspect of NumPy functionality. Below are brief descriptions of the included scripts:

1. `numpy_examples.py`: This script contains several examples demonstrating different features of NumPy, such as array creation, manipulation, arithmetic operations, statistical functions, and array slicing.

## Examples

- **Array Creation**: Creating arrays using `np.array`, `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, `np.linspace`, `np.arange`.
- **Array Manipulation**: Reshaping arrays, copying arrays, reversing arrays.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Performing element-wise arithmetic operations on arrays.
- **Statistical Functions**: Computing mean, median, and other statistical properties of arrays.
- **Array Slicing**: Extracting specific portions of arrays using slicing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- NumPy
